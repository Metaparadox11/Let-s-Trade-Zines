For one, you could send the user a message asking if they are interested in trading, or you could suggest a trade with them through their profile (there is a button that says 'suggest a trade'). If the other user is interested you can either arrange to trade informally/without officially setting up a trade (do this at your own risk, as it will not add to your completed trades and you will be unable to rate the other user) or officially suggest and agree to a trade through the trading system (see 'trades' on the navigation menu on the home screen).\n\nOnce you have agreed in some way to a trade, it is up to you to exchange contact information. It is recommended that you share email addresses or other online contact info through Let's Trade Zines messages and share more sensitive information through more secured means, but you could also exchange addresses through Let's Trade Zines messages. The database in which messages are stored is secured by Google Firebase and messages are encrypted, but Let's Trade Zines cannot absolutely guarantee the security of your messages.

                android:textSize="20sp"
                android:text="There are three stages of a trade on Let's Trade Zines, plus three trade attributes. This sounds complicated, but it is actually fairly simple ouside of a few rare cases. The first stage of a trade is the suggested trade. A suggested trade is not open yet, and will be deleted if rejected by the person who receives it. The sender of a suggested trade can also delete it with one click before it is accepted by the other user. Your trades page shows both trades suggested by you and trades suggested to you and any available options for these.\n\nOnce the recipient of a trade request accepts it (the first trade attribute is whether it is accepted), the trade enters the second stage: the open trade. Once a trade is open, you should share contact information with the other user and trade zines either by email or snail mail. Once you have received the zine(s) from the other user, you can mark the trade completed (the second attribute.) You may also cancel a trade, but it will only be deleted if both users cancel (the third attribute) it.\n\nIf a user cancels a trade after marking it completed the trade will remain open for 30 days and then move to completed trades (or sooner if the other user marks it completed.) (You don't really want to cancel a trade after marking it completed unless you've agreed with the other user to mutually cancel the trade, as you will probably get a bad rating if you haven't already sent out your zines to the other user.) This situation (30 days until completed) can also happen if one person marks a trade completed and the other cancels. If your trade partner marks your zines received (after which they cannot cancel) and you never receive anything, you can choose cancel to force the trade to close after 30 days, after which you can rate appropriately. Once you cancel a trade, you cannot mark it completed.\n\nThe third stage of a trade is the completed trade. A trade is considered completed if both users involved mark it completed or in the cases described previously, otherwise an open trade will stay open indefinitely. Once a trade is completed, users can rate the other user (See the question on the trade rating system.)" />
